# To Do

1. Decide on research questions. This will define our initial dive into the data. Defining some base questions up front prevents 'decision paralysis' when confronting a data set for the first time.
2. Gather data that will support answering the research questions.
..* College Football Data
..* University of Iowa arrest records
..* Johnson County arrest records
..* Johnson County maps
3. Transform. Filter, format, etc...
4. Analyze \& iterate.
5. Document, publish, profit.
